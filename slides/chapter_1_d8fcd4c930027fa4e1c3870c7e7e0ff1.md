Hi, my name is Hugo and I'll be your host for Introduction to Python for Data Science.

I'm a data scientist and educator at DataCamp.

## How you will learn

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 30ee08a725
disable_transition: false

![DataCamp Interface](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/288/datasets/729574d2168960686381caefe79baf5978e27d0d/liveexercise.gif)

`@script`
In this course, you will learn Python for Data Science through video lessons, like this one, and interactive exercises. You're learning by doing, while receiving customized and instant feedback on your work.

- General purpose: build anything {{2}}

- Build your skills bit by bit {{3}}

`@script`
People often refer to Python as the swiss army knife of programming languages as you can do almost anything with it.
In this course, we'll start to build up your data science coding skills bit by bit, so make sure to stick around to see how powerful the language can be.

Python shell, a place where you can type Python code and immediately see the results. In DataCamp's exercise interface, this shell is embedded here. Let's start off simple and use Python as a calculator.

Let me type 4 + 5, and hit Enter. Python interprets what you typed and prints the result of your calculation, 9. 

Apart from interactively working with Python, you can also have Python run so called

`@script`
python scripts. These python scripts are simply text files with the extension (dot) py. It's basically a list of Python commands that are executed, almost as if you where typing the commands in the shell yourself, line by line.

`@script`
Let's put the command from before in a script now. The next step is executing the script, by clicking 'Submit Answer'. If you execute this script in the DataCamp interface, there's nothing in the output pane. That's because you have to explicitly use print inside scripts if you want to generate output during execution.

- Use `print()` to generate output from script

`@script`
Let's wrap our previous calculation in a print call, and rerun the script. This time, the same output as before is generated, great! Putting your code in Python scripts instead of manually retyping every step interactively will help you to keep structure and avoid retyping everything over and over again if you want to make a change; you simply make the change in the script, and rerun the entire thing.

Now that you've got an idea about different ways of working with Python, I suggest you head over to the exercises.
