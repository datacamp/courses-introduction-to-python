`@script`
In this video, I'm going to introduce you to functions. Once you learn about them you won't be able to stop using them. I sure can't.

---

## Functions

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 5f508018d7
```

`@part1`
- Nothing new!{{1}}

- type(){{2}}

- Piece of reusable code{{3}}

- Solves particular task{{4}}

- Call function instead of writing code yourself{{5}}

`@script`
Functions aren't entirely new for you actually: you've already used them. type, for example, is a function that returns the type of a value. But what is a function? Simply put, a function is a piece of reusable code, aimed at solving a particular task. You can call functions instead of having to write code yourself. Maybe an example can clarify things here.

---

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: c2afbb6435
code_zoom: 75
```

`@part1`
```py
fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
fam
```

```out
[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
```

```py
max(fam)
```{{1}}

```out
1.89
```{{1}}

![ch_3_1_slides.012.png](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/288/datasets/efef98eb50aba2b36df52166f7c4b18fd89c62e1/ch_3_1_slides.012.png){{2}}

`@script`
Suppose you have the list containing only the heights of your family, fam:

Say that you want to get the maximum value in this list. Instead of writing your own piece of Python code that goes through the list and finds the highest value, you can also use Python's max function. This is one of Python's built-in functions, just like type. We simply pass fam to max inside parentheses.

The output makes sense: 1-point-89, the highest number in the list.

max worked kind of like a black box here:

---

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 46af509641
disable_transition: true
code_zoom: 75
```

`@part1`
```py
fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
fam
```

```out
[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
```

```py
max(fam)
```

```out
1.89
```

![ch_3_1_slides.013.png](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/288/datasets/65f70092ec124c8f29a082f9409e473496806aaa/ch_3_1_slides.013.png)

`@script`
you passed it a list, then the implementation of max, that you don't know, did its magic,

---

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: c575524d98
disable_transition: true
code_zoom: 75
```

`@part1`
```py
fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
fam
```

```out
[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
```

```py
max(fam)
```

```out
1.89
```

![ch_3_1_slides.014.png](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/288/datasets/404545609ab865031039dcfd81ea2d2962126f72/ch_3_1_slides.014.png)

`@script`
and produced an output. How max actually did this, is not important to you, it just does what it's supposed to, and you didn't have to write your own code, which made your life easier.

---

## Example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: bed6186ee9
disable_transition: true
code_zoom: 75
```

`@part1`
```py
fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
fam
```

```out
[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
```

```py
max(fam)
```

```out
1.89
```

```py
tallest = max(fam)
tallest
```{{1}}

```out
1.89
```{{1}}

`@script`
Of course, it's possible to also assign the result of a function call to a new variable, like here. Now tallest is just like any other variable; you can use to continue your fancy calculations.

## round()

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: b6626f6bff
code_zoom: 60
```

`@part1`
```py
round(1.68, 1)
```{{1}}

```out
1.7
```{{1}}

```py
round(1.68)
```{{2}}

```out
2
```{{2}}

```py
help(round) # Open up documentation
```{{3}}

```out
  round(...)
      round(number[, ndigits]) -> number
      
      Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits (default 0 digits). 
      This returns an int when called with one argument, 
      otherwise the same type as the number. 
      ndigits may be negative.
```{{3}}

`@script`
Another one of these built-in functions is round. It takes two inputs: first, a number you want to round, and second, the precision with which to round, so how many digits behind the decimal point you want to keep. Say you want to round 1-point-68 to one decimal place. The first input is 1-point-68, the second input is 1. You separate the inputs with a comma.

But there's more. It's perfectly possible to call the round function with only one input, like this. This time, Python figured out that you didn't specify the second input, and automatically chooses to round the number to the closest integer.

To understand why both approaches work, let's open up the documentation. You can do this with yet another function, help, like this.

It appears that round takes two inputs.

`@script`
In Python, these inputs, also called arguments, have names: number and ndigits. When you call the function round,

`@script`
The round function does its calculations with number and ndigits as if they are variables in a Python script. We don't know exactly what code Python executes. What is important, though, is that the function produces an output,

- `round(number)`{{1}}
- `round(number, ndigits)`{{1}}

`@script`
How was I so sure that calling the function with a single input would work? Well, in the documentation, there are square brackets around the comma and the ndigits here. This tells us that you can call round in this form, as well as in this one. In other words, ndigits is an optional argument. Actually, Python offers yet another way to show that a function has optional arguments, but that's something for the exercises.

`@script`
By now, you have an idea about how to use max and round, but how could you know that a function such as round exists in Python in the first place? Well, this is something you will learn with time. Whenever you are doing a rather standard task in Python, you can be pretty sure that there's already a function that can do this for you. In that case, you should definitely use it! Just do a quick internet search and you'll find the function you need with a nice usage example. And there is of course DataCamp, where you'll also learn about powerful functions and how to use them.
