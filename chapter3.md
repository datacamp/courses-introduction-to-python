## Familiar functions

```

Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) and [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type). There are also functions like [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) and [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of `3.0` and store the output as a new variable, `result`, you can use the following:

```
result = type(3.0)
```

`@instructions`
- Use [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) in combination with [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) to print out the type of `var1`.
- Use [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) to get the length of the list `var1`. Wrap it in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call to directly print it out.
- Use [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) to convert `var2` to an integer. Store the output as `out2`.

`@hint`
- Call the [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) function like this: `type(var1)`.
- Call [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) like you did so many times before. Simply put the variable you want to print in parentheses.
- `int(x)` will convert `x` to an integer.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
____

# Print out length of var1
____

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = ____
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))

# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined variables."
Ex().check_object("var1", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)
Ex().check_object("var2", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)

patt = "__JINJA__:Make sure to print out the %s of `var1` with `{{sol_call}}`."
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = patt % 'type')
Ex().has_printout(1, not_printed_msg = patt % 'length')

int_miss_msg = "Have you used [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) to make an integer of `var2`?"
int_incorr_msg = "Have you passed `var2` to [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)?"
Ex().check_correct(
  check_object("out2").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="You called `int()` correctly; now make sure to assign the result of this call to `out2`."),
  check_function("int", missing_msg=int_miss_msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=int_incorr_msg)
)
success_msg("Great job! The `len()` function is extremely useful; it also works on strings to count the number of characters!")

## Help!

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: 679b852978
lang: python
xp: 50
skills:
  - 2
```

Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: `help()`. In IPython specifically, you can also use `?` before the function name.

To get help on the `max()` function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

```
help(max)
?max
```

Use the IPython Shell to open up the documentation on [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow). Do this by typing `?pow` or `help(pow)` and hitting **Enter**.

Which of the following statements is true?

`@possible_answers`
- `pow()` takes three arguments: `base`, `exp`, and `mod`. Without `mod`, the function will return an error.
- `pow()` takes three required arguments: `base`, `exp`, and `None`.
- `pow()` requires `base` and `exp` arguments; `mod` is optional.
- `pow()` takes two arguments: `exp` and `mod`. Missing `exp` results in an error.

`@hint`
- Optional arguments are set `=` to a default value, which the function will use if that argument is not specified.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = "Not quite. `mod` has a default value that will be used if you don't specify a value."
msg2 = "Incorrect. `None` is the default value for the `mod` argument."
msg3 = "Perfect! Using `help()` can help you understand how functions work, unleashing their full potential!"
msg4 = "Incorrect. `pow()` takes three arguments, one of which has a default value."
Ex().has_chosen(3, [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4])
```

---

## Multiple arguments

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: e30486d7c1
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

In the previous exercise, you identified optional arguments by viewing the documentation with `help()`. You'll now apply this to change the behavior of the `sorted()` function.

Have a look at the documentation of [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) by typing `help(sorted)` in the IPython Shell.

You'll see that `sorted()` takes three arguments: `iterable`, `key`, and `reverse`. In this exercise, you'll only have to specify `iterable` and `reverse`, not `key`.

Two lists have been created for you.

Can you paste them together and sort them in descending order?

`@instructions`
- Use `+` to merge the contents of `first` and `second` into a new list: `full`.
- Call `sorted()` and on `full` and specify the `reverse` argument to be `True`. Save the sorted list as `full_sorted`.
- Finish off by printing out `full_sorted`.

`@hint`
- Sum `first` and `second` as if they are two numbers and assign the result to `full`.
- Use `sorted()` with two inputs: `full` and `reverse=True`.
- To print out a variable, use `print()`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = ____ + ____

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = ____

# Print out full_sorted
____
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse=True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the already variables `first` and `second`."
Ex().multi(
  check_object("first", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg),
  check_object("second", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)
)
Ex().check_correct(
  check_object("full_sorted").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Make sure you assign the result of calling `sorted()` to `full_sorted`."),
  check_function("sorted").multi(
    check_args(0).has_equal_value(),
    check_args('reverse').has_equal_value()
  )

## String Methods

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 4039302ee0
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Strings come with a bunch of methods. Follow the instructions closely to discover some of them. If you want to discover them in more detail, you can always type `help(str)` in the IPython Shell.

A string `place` has already been created for you to experiment with.

`@instructions`
- Use the [`.upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method on `place` and store the result in `place_up`. Use the syntax for calling methods that you learned in the previous video.
- Print out `place` and `place_up`. Did both change?
- Print out the number of o's on the variable `place` by calling [`.count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count) on `place` and passing the letter `'o'` as an input to the method. We're talking about the variable `place`, not the word `"place"`!

`@hint`
- You can call the [`.upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method on `place` without any additional inputs.
- To print out a variable `x`, you can write `print(x)`.
- Make sure to wrap your `place.count(____)` call in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function so that you print it out.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place
place_up = 

# Print out place and place_up



# Print out the number of o's in place

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place
place_up = place.upper()

# Print out place and place_up
print(place)
print(place_up)

# Print out the number of o's in place
print(place.count('o'))
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined variables."
Ex().check_object("place", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)

patt = "Don't forget to print out `%s`."
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg=patt % "place")
Ex().check_correct(
    has_printout(1, not_printed_msg=patt % "place_up"),
    check_correct(
        check_object("place_up").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Assign the result of your `place.upper()` call to `place_up`."),
        check_function("place.upper", signature=False)
    )
)    

# check count of place
Ex().check_correct(
  has_printout(2, not_printed_msg = "You have calculated the number of o's in `place` fine; now make sure to wrap `place.count('o')` call in a `print()` function to print out the result."),
  check_function("place.count", signature=False).check_args(0).has_equal_value()
)

success_msg("Nice! Notice from the printouts that the [upper()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method does not change the object it is called on. This will be different for lists in the next exercise!")

## List Methods

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 0dbe8ed695
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

- [`.index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
- [`.count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.

`@instructions`
- Use the [`.index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index) method to get the index of the element in `areas` that is equal to `20.0`. Print out this index.
- Call [`.count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count) on `areas` to find out how many times `9.50` appears in the list. Again, simply print out this number.

`@hint`
- To print out the index, wrap the `areas.index(___)` call in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function.
- To print out the number of times an element `x` occurs in the list, wrap the `areas.count(___)` call in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0


# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))
```

`@sct`
```{python}
predef_msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined list `areas`."

Ex().check_object("areas", missing_msg=predef_msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=predef_msg)

Ex().check_function("print", index=0).check_args(0).check_function('areas.index', signature=False).check_args(0).has_equal_value()


Ex().check_function("print", index=1).check_args(0).check_function('areas.count', signature=False).has_equal_value()

success_msg("Nice! These were examples of `list` methods that did not change the list they were called on.")
```

---

## List Methods (2)

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 1fbeab82d0
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:

- [`.append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
- [`.remove()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
- [`.reverse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: `areas`.

`@instructions`
- Use [`.append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) twice to add the size of the poolhouse and the garage again: `24.5` and `15.45`, respectively. Make sure to add them in this order.
- Print out `areas`
- Use the [`.reverse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) method to reverse the order of the elements in `areas`.
- Print out `areas` once more.

`@hint`
- For the first instruction, use the `areas.append(___)` call twice.
- To print out a variable `x`, simply write `print(x)`.
- The [`.reverse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) method does not require additional inputs; just use the dot notation and empty parentheses: `.reverse()`.
- To print out a variable `x`, simply write `print(x)`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size



# Print out areas


# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas


# Print out areas

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)

# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().multi(
  check_function("areas.append", index=0, signature=False).check_args(0).has_equal_value(),
  check_function("areas.append", index=1, signature=False).check_args(0).has_equal_value(),
  check_function("print", index=0).check_args(0).has_equal_ast(),
  check_function("areas.reverse", index=0, signature=False),

## Import package

```yaml

```

Let's say you wanted to calculate the circumference and area of a circle. Here's what those formulas look like:

$$C = 2 \pi r$$
$$A = \pi r^2 $$

Rather than typing the number for `pi`, you can use the `math` package that contains the number

For reference, `**` is the symbol for exponentiation. For example `3**4` is `3` to the power of `4` and will give `81`.

`@instructions`
- Import the `math` package.
- Use `math.pi` to calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in `C`.
- Use `math.pi` to calculate the area of the circle and store it in `A`.

`@hint`
- You can simply use `import math`, and then refer to `pi` with `math.pi`.
- Use the equation in the assignment text to find `C`. Use `*`
- Use the equation in the assignment text to find `A`. Use `*` and `**`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Import the math package
import ____

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * ____

# Calculate A
A = ____ * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * math.pi

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
```

`@sct`

## Selective import

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: fe65eff50a
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

General imports, like `import math`, make **all** functionality from the `math` package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

```
from math import pi
```

Try the same thing again, but this time only use `pi`.

`@instructions`
- Perform a selective import from the `math` package where you only import the `pi` function.
- Use `math.pi` to calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in `C`.
- Use `math.pi` to calculate the area of the circle and store it in `A`.
- Print out `dist`.

`@hint`
- Use `from math import pi` to do the selective import.
- Now, you can use `pi` on it's own!
- To print out a variable `x`, simply type `print(x)`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Import pi function of math package
from math import ____

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * ____

# Calculate A
A = ____ * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Import pi function of math package
from math import pi

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * pi

# Calculate A
A = pi * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
```

`@sct`
```{python}
patt = "Your calculation of `%s` is not quite correct. Make sure to use only `pi`."

Ex().has_import("math.pi", not_imported_msg = "Be sure to import `pi` from the `math` package. You should use the `from ___ import ___` notation.",)

## Different ways of importing

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: f1b2675a2a
lang: python
xp: 50
skills:
  - 2
```

There are several ways to import packages and modules into Python. Depending on the import call, you'll have to use different Python code.

Suppose you want to use the function [`inv()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.inv.html), which is in the `linalg` subpackage of the `scipy` package. You want to be able to use this function as follows:

```
my_inv([[1,2], [3,4]])
```

Which `import` statement will you need in order to run the above code without an error?

`@possible_answers`
- `import scipy`
- `import scipy.linalg`
- `from scipy.linalg import my_inv`
- `from scipy.linalg import inv as my_inv`

`@hint`
- Try the different import statements in the IPython shell and see which one causes the line `my_inv([[1, 2], [3, 4]])` to run without errors. Hit **enter** to run the code you have typed.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = msg2 = msg3 = "Incorrect, try again. Try the different import statements in the IPython shell and see which one causes the line `my_inv([[1, 2], [3, 4]])` to run without errors."
msg4 = "Correct! The `as` word allows you to create a local name for the function you're importing: `inv()` is now available as `my_inv()`."
Ex().has_chosen(4, [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4])
```
