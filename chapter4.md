## Your First NumPy Array

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 84cab9d170
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

You're now going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of `numpy`, a powerful package to do data science.

A list `baseball` has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code to create a `numpy` array from it?

`@instructions`
- Import the `numpy` package as `np`, so that you can refer to `numpy` with `np`.
- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name this array `np_baseball`.
- Print out the type of `np_baseball` to check that you got it right.

`@hint`
- `import numpy as np` will do the trick. Now, you have to use `np.fun_name()` whenever you want to use a `numpy` function.
- [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) should take on input `baseball`. Assign the result of the function call to `np_baseball`.
- To print out the type of a variable `x`, simply type `print(type(x))`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Import the numpy package as np


baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball


# Print out type of np_baseball

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Create a NumPy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
```

## Baseball players' height

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: e7e25a89ea
lang: python

```

You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: `height_in`. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a `numpy` array out of it and convert the units to meters?

`height_in` is already available and the `numpy` package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: stat.ucla.edu).

`@instructions`
- Create a `numpy` array from `height_in`. Name this new array `np_height_in`.
- Print `np_height_in`.
- Multiply `np_height_in` with `0.0254` to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, `np_height_m`.
- Print out `np_height_m` and check if the output makes sense.

`@hint`
- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) and pass it `height`. Store the result in `np_height_in`.
- To print out a variable `x`, type `print(x)` in the Python script.
- Perform calculations as if `np_height_in` is a single number: `np_height_in * conversion_factor` is part of the answer.
- To print out a variable `x`, type `print(x)` in the Python script.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
mlb = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")
height_in = mlb['Height'].tolist()
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in


# Print out np_height_in


# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m


# Print np_height_m

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)
```

## NumPy Side Effects

```yaml

lang: python

```

`numpy` is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, `numpy` arrays cannot contain elements with different types. 
Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` have a different meaning for regular Python lists and `numpy` arrays.

Some lines of code have been provided for you. Try these out and select the one that would match this:

```
np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])
```

The `numpy` package is already imported as `np`.

`@possible_answers`
- `np.array([True, 1, 2, 3, 4, False])`
- `np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2])`
- `np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1])`
- `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`

`@hint`
- Copy the different code chunks and paste them in the IPython Shell. Hit **enter** to run the code and see which output matches the one generated by `np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import numpy as np
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = msg3 = msg4 = "Incorrect. Try out the different code chunks and see which one matches the target code chunk."
msg2 = "Great job! `True` is converted to 1, `False` is converted to 0."
Ex().has_chosen(2, [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4])

## Subsetting NumPy Arrays

```yaml

key: fcb2a9007b
lang: python

```

Subsetting (using the square bracket notation on lists or arrays) works exactly the same with both lists and arrays.

This exercise already has two lists, `height_in` and `weight_lb`, loaded in the background for you. These contain the height and weight of the MLB players as regular lists. It also has two `numpy` array lists, `np_weight_lb` and `np_height_in` prepared for you.

`@instructions`
- Subset `np_weight_lb` by printing out the element at index 50.
- Print out a sub-array of `np_height_in` that contains the elements at index 100 up to **and including** index 110.

`@hint`
- Make sure to wrap a `print()` call around your subsetting operations.
- Use `[100:111]` to get the elements from index 100 up to and including index 110.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
mlb = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")
height_in = mlb['Height'].tolist()
weight_lb = mlb['Weight'].tolist()
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
import numpy as np

np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out the weight at index 50


# Print out sub-array of np_height_in: index 100 up to and including index 110

```

`@solution`
```{python}
import numpy as np

np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight_lb[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height_in: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height_in[100:111])
```

## Your First 2D NumPy Array

```yaml

```

Before working on the actual MLB data, let's try to create a 2D `numpy` array from a small list of lists.

In this exercise, `baseball` is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. `baseball` is already coded for you in the script.

`@instructions`
- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a 2D `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.
- Print out the type of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the `shape` attribute of `np_baseball`. Use `np_baseball.shape`.

`@hint`
- `baseball` is already coded for you in the script. Call [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) on it and store the resulting 2D `numpy` array in `np_baseball`.
- Use [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) in combination with [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) for the second instruction.
- `np_baseball.shape` will give you the dimensions of the `np_baseball`. Make sure to wrap a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call around it.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
import numpy as np

baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball


# Print out the type of np_baseball


# Print out the shape of np_baseball

```

`@solution`

You realize that it makes more sense to restructure all this information in a 2D `numpy` array.

You have a Python list of lists. In this list of lists, each sublist represents the height and weight of a single baseball player. The name of this list is `baseball` and it has been loaded for you already (although you can't see it).

Store the data as a 2D array to unlock `numpy`'s extra functionality.

`@instructions`
- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a 2D `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.
- Print out the `shape` attribute of `np_baseball`.

`@hint`
- `baseball` is already available in the Python environment. Call [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) on it and store the resulting 2D `numpy` array in `np_baseball`.
- `np_baseball.shape` will give the dimensions of the `np_baseball`. Make sure to wrap a `print()`call around it.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight']].to_numpy().tolist()
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}

## Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays

```yaml

lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

If your 2D `numpy` array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements `"a"` and `"c"` are extracted from a list of lists.

```
# numpy
import numpy as np
np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[:, 0]
```

The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The `:` is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.

`@instructions`
- Print out the 50th row of `np_baseball`.
- Make a new variable, `np_weight_lb`, containing the entire second column of `np_baseball`.
- Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in `np_baseball` and print it out.

`@hint`
- You need row index 49 in the first instruction! More specifically, you'll want to use `[49, :]`.
- To select the entire second column, you'll need `[:, 1]`.
- For the last instruction, use `[123, 0]`; don't forget to wrap it all in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight']].to_numpy().tolist()
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball


# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb


# Print out height of 124th player

```

`@solution`
```{python}
import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123, 0])
```

`@sct`
```{python}

)

```

2D `numpy` arrays can perform calculations element by element, like `numpy` arrays.

`np_baseball` is coded for you; it's again a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns representing height (in inches), weight (in pounds) and age (in years). `baseball` is available as a regular list of lists and `updated` is available as 2D numpy array.

`@instructions`
- You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D `numpy` array, `updated`. Add `np_baseball` and `updated` and print out the result.
- You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms, respectively). As a first step, create a `numpy` array with three values: `0.0254`, `0.453592` and `1`. Name this array `conversion`.
- Multiply `np_baseball` with `conversion` and print out the result.

`@hint`
- `np_baseball + updated` will do an element-wise summation of the two `numpy` arrays.
- Create a `numpy` array with `np.array()`; the input is a regular Python list with three elements.
- `np_baseball * conversion` will work, without extra work. Try out it! Make sure to wrap it in a `print()` call.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight', 'Age']].to_numpy().tolist()
n = len(baseball)
updated = np.array(pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/update.csv", header = None))
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated


# Create numpy array: conversion


# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion

```

`@solution`

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated

You now know how to use `numpy` functions to get a better feeling for your data. 

The baseball data is available as a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns (height, weight, age) and 1015 rows. The name of this `numpy` array is `np_baseball`. After restructuring the data, however, you notice that some height values are abnormally high. Follow the instructions and discover which summary statistic is best suited if you're dealing with so-called _outliers_. `np_baseball` is available.

`@instructions`
- Create `numpy` array `np_height_in` that is equal to first column of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the mean of `np_height_in`.
- Print out the median of `np_height_in`.

`@hint`
- Use 2D `numpy` subsetting: `[:,0]` is a part of the solution.
- If `numpy` is imported as `np`, you can use [`np.mean()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) to get the mean of a NumPy array. Don't forget to throw in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call.
- For the last instruction, use [`np.median()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.median.html).

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
np_baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight', 'Age']].to_numpy()
np_baseball[slice(0, 1015, 50), 0] = np_baseball[slice(0, 1015, 50), 0]*1000
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball


# Print out the mean of np_height_in


# Print out the median of np_height_in

```

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball
np_height_in = np_baseball[:,0]

# Print out the mean of np_height_in
print(np.mean(np_height_in))

# Print out the median of np_height_in
print(np.median(np_height_in))
```

Because the mean and median are so far apart, you decide to complain to the MLB. They find the error and send the corrected data over to you. It's again available as a 2D NumPy array `np_baseball`, with three columns.

The Python script in the editor already includes code to print out informative messages with the different summary statistics and `numpy` is already loaded as `np`. Can you finish the job? `np_baseball` is available.

`@instructions`
- The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Use [`np.std()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) on the first column of `np_baseball` to calculate `stddev`. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Do big players tend to be heavier? Use [`np.corrcoef()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html) to store the correlation between the first and second column of `np_baseball` in `corr`. Replace `None` with the correct code.

`@hint`
- Use [`np.median()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.median.html) to calculate the median. Make sure to select to correct column first!
- Subset the same column when calculating the standard deviation with [`np.std()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html).
- Use `np_baseball[:, 0]` and `np_baseball[:, 1]` to select the first and second columns; these are the inputs to [`np.corrcoef()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html).

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
import pandas as pd
np_baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight', 'Age']].to_numpy()
import numpy as np
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height
med = ____
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height
stddev = ____
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column
corr = ____
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))
```

`@solution`
```{python}
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0], np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))
```
