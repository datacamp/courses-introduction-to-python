## Your first Python code

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: bdc52f0e19
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

It's time to run your first Python code!

Head to the code and hit the run code button to see the output.

`@instructions`
- Hit the run button to see the output of `print(5 / 8)`.
- Hit the submit button to complete the exercise.

`@hint`
- Run the code first before submitting your answer so you have time to explore the output.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Hit run code to see the output!
print(5 / 8)
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Hit run code to see the output!
print(5 / 8)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "__JINJA__:Have you used `{{sol_call}}` to print out `5 / 8`?")
success_msg("Great! On to the next one!")
```

## Python as a calculator

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 0f7c039428
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. It can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The code in the script gives some examples.

Now it's your turn to practice by writing some code yourself.

`@instructions`
- Print the result of subtracting `5` from `5` under `# Subtraction` using `print()`.
- Print the result of multiplying `3` by `5` under `# Multiplication`.

`@hint`
- You'll need to use `print()` to generate an output.
- You can subtract with `-` and multiply with `*`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
 
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Addition and division
print(4 + 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Subtraction


# Multiplication

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Addition and division
print(4 + 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Subtraction
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication
print(3 * 5)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(4 + 5)` to print out the result of your sum?")

Ex().has_printout(1, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(5 - 5)` to print out the result of your subtration?")

Ex().has_printout(2, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(3 * 5)` to print out the result of your multiplication?")

Ex().has_printout(3, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(10 / 2)` to print out the result of your division?")

success_msg("That's correct! Python can help you do the math, a characteristic that will be helpful for analysis as we grow our data skills.")
```

## Variables and Types

## Variable Assignment

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 4bf65ad83e
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Python variables allow you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable `x` with a value of `5`, you use `=`, like this: `x = 5`.

You can now use the name of this variable, `x`, instead of the actual value, `5`.

Try it in the exercise by replacing `____` with your code.

`@instructions`
- Create a variable `savings` with the value of `100`.
- Check out this variable by typing `print(savings)` in the script.

`@hint`
- Type `savings = 100` to create the variable `savings`.
- After creating the variable `savings`, you can type `print(savings)`.
- Your final code should not include any `____`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
 
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a variable savings
____

# Print out savings
____
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_object("savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Assign `100` to the variable `savings`.")
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "Print out `savings`, the variable you created, with `print(savings)`.")
success_msg("Great! Let's try to do some calculations with this variable now!")
```

## Calculations with variables

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: ff06cedeb4
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

You've now created a savings variable, so let's start saving!

How much money would you have saved four months from now, if you saved $10 each month?

`@instructions`
- Create a variable `monthly_savings`, equal to `10` and `num_months`, equal to `4`.
- Multiply `monthly_savings` by `num_months` and assign it to `new_savings`, replacing `____`.
- Print the value of `new_savings`.

`@hint`
- You can do calculations with variables the same way as with numbers so instead of `10 * 4`, replace the numbers with the variables!
- Use `print()` to see the amount in `new_savings`.
- Take care to spell the variables correctly!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months



# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = ____

# Print new_savings

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Print new_savings
print(new_savings)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_object("monthly_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you save `10` to `monthly_savings` using `monthly_savings = 10`?")
Ex().check_object("num_months").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you save `4` to `num_months` using `num_months = 4`?")
Ex().check_object("new_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you use the correct variables and symbols to multiply? Expected `monthly_savings * num_months` but got something else.")
# Ex().check_object("total_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you use the correct variables and symbols to add? Expected `savings + new_savings` but got something else.")

Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg="Remember to print out `new_savings` at the end of your script.")

success_msg("You have $40 in new savings!")
```

## Other variable types

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 006b48561f
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

In the previous exercise, you worked with the integer Python data type, `int`. 

Next to numerical data types, there are other common data types: 
- `float`, or floating: supports fractional numbers like 1.1
- `str`, or string: represents text like "Hello"
- `bool`, or boolean: a type to represent `True` or `False` (the capitalization is important!)

`@instructions`
- Create a new float, `half`, with the value `0.5`.
- Create a new string, `intro`, with the value `"Hello! How are you?"`.
- Create a new boolean, `is_good`, with the value `True`.

`@hint`
- To create a variable in Python, use `=`. Make sure to wrap your string in single or double quotes.
- Only two boolean values exist in Python: `True` and `False`. `TRUE`, `true`, `FALSE`, `false` and other versions will not be accepted.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a variable half


# Create a variable intro


# Create a variable is_good

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_object("half").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you save the float, `0.5` to `half`?")

Ex().check_object("intro").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Hmm, something is incorrect in your `intro` variable. Double check the spelling and make sure you've used quotation marks.")

Ex().check_object("is_good").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you capitalize the boolean value? Remember you don't need to use quotation marks here.")

success_msg("Nice!")
```

## Operations with other types

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: 4d0d83cc02

```

Youâ€™ve seen different variable types in action, but different types also behave differently. 

When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

Time for you to test this out.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

***

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 7b7fdfbeaf
xp: 50
```

`@instructions`
- Add `savings` and `new_savings` and assign it to `total_savings`.
- Use `type()` to print the resulting type of `total_savings`.

`@hint`
- Assign `savings + new_savings` to a new variable, `total_savings`.
- To print the type of a variable `x`, use `print(type(x))`.

`@sample_code`
```{python}
savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
____
print(total_savings)

# Print the type of total_savings
print(____)
```

`@solution`
```{python}
savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings
print(total_savings)

# Print the type of total_savings
print(type(total_savings))
```

`@sct`
```{python}
# predefined
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined variables."

Ex().multi(
    check_object('savings', missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg),
    check_object('new_savings', missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)
)

Ex().multi(
    check_object("total_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Add `savings` and `new_savings` to create the `total_savings` variable."),
    has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "__JINJA__:Use `{{sol_call}}` to print out the type of `total_savings`.")
)
```

***

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: d02013efc2
xp: 50
```

`@instructions`
- Calculate the sum of `intro` and `intro` and assign the result to `doubleintro`.
- Print out `doubleintro`. Did you expect this?

`@hint`
- Assign `intro + intro` to a new variable, `doubleintro`.
- To print a variable `x`, write `print(x)` in the script.

`@sample_code`
```{python}
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro
____

# Print out doubleintro
print(____)
```

`@solution`
```{python}
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro
doubleintro = intro + intro

# Print out doubleintro
print(doubleintro)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
# predefined
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined variables."

Ex().check_object('intro', missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)

Ex().multi(
    check_object("doubleintro").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg  = "Have you stored the result of `intro + intro` in `doubleintro`?"),
    has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "Don't forget to print out `doubleintro`.")
)

success_msg("Nice. Notice how `intro + intro` causes `\"Hello! How are you?\"` and `\"Hello! How are you?\"` to be pasted together.")
```
