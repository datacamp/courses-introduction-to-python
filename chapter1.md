## When to use Python?

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 9703b117fb
kind: PureMultipleChoice
xp: 50
```

Python is a **flexible** language. For which applications can you use Python?

`@hint`
- Practically any piece of software can be built using Python.

`@possible_answers`
- For quick calculations.
- Develop a database-driven website.
- Clean and analyze data.
- [All of the above.]

`@feedback`
- "Python can do more than quick calculations!"
- "There is a very popular Python framework to build database-driven websites, but it can do much more."
- "Python is a powerful tool for data analysis, but it has other uses, too."
- "Correct! Python is an extremely flexible language."

## The Python Interface

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: bdc52f0e19
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Hit **Continue** to check out the instructions and run your first Python code with Datacamp!

`@instructions`
- Try hitting _Run Code_ to see the output of your code in the **Shell** tab, then hit _Back to Code_.
- Hit _Submit_ to execute the Python script and receive feedback.

`@hint`
- You can hit _Run Code_ and _Submit_ as often as you want; if you're stuck, you can tap on the lightbulb icon at the bottom of the screen to get a hint , and ultimately _Show Solution_.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# See what happens when you hit Run Code
print(5 / 8)

print(7 + 10)
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# See what happens when you hit Run Code
print(5 / 8)

print(7 + 10)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "Make sure you are still printing something!")
Ex().has_printout(1, not_printed_msg = "Make sure you are still printing something!")
success_msg("Great! You can also use the **Shell** interactively by simply typing commands and hitting 'Run Code'. When you work in the shell directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment.")
```

---

## Any comments?

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 7c4a738a13
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

You can also add **comments** to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about and do not run as Python code.

They start with `#` tag. See the comment in the editor, `# Division`; now it's your turn to add a comment!

`@instructions`
- Above the `print(7 + 10)`, add the comment:
```
# Addition
```
You can copy the text by tapping it and then tapping the underscores ____ in the code below.

`@hint`
- Try copying and pasting the comment rather than typing it out by tapping the comment to automatically copy it, then tap and hold the underscores and select paste!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Division
print(5 / 8)

____
print(7 + 10)
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_code("#\s*(\w+)[\s.!?]*print\s*\(\s*7", not_typed_msg = "Make sure to add the comment right before `print(7 + 10)`.")
success_msg("Great!")
```

## Python as a calculator

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 0f7c039428
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. It can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The code in the script gives some examples.

Now it's your turn to practice!

`@instructions`
- Print the sum of `4 + 5`.
- Print the result of subtracting `5` from `5`.
- Print the result of multiplying `3` by `5`.
- Print the result of dividing `10` by `2`.

`@hint`
- You'll need to use `print()` to generate an output.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
 
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Addition


# Subtraction


# Multiplication


# Division

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Addition
print(4 + 5)

# Subtraction
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication
print(3 * 5)

# Division
print(10 / 2)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(4 + 5)` to print out the result of your sum?")

Ex().has_printout(1, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(5 - 5)` to print out the result of your subtration?")

Ex().has_printout(2, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(3 * 5)` to print out the result of your multiplication?")

Ex().has_printout(3, not_printed_msg = "Have you used `print(10 / 2)` to print out the result of your division?")

success_msg("That's correct! Python can help you do the math, a characteristic that will be helpful for analysis as we grow our data skills.")
```

## Variable Assignment

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 4bf65ad83e
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable `x` with a value of `5`, you use `=`, like this example:

```
x = 5
```

You can now use the name of this variable, `x`, instead of the actual value, `5`.

Remember, `=` in Python means _assignment_, it doesn't test equality!

`@instructions`
- Create a variable `savings` with the value of `100`.
- Check out this variable by typing `print(savings)` in the script.

`@hint`
- Type `savings = 100` to create the variable `savings`.
- After creating the variable `savings`, you can type `print(savings)`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
 
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a variable savings


# Print out savings

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_object("savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Assign `100` to the variable `savings`.")
Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "Print out `savings`, the variable you created, with `print(savings)`.")
success_msg("Great! Let's try to do some calculations with this variable now!")
```

## Calculations with variables

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: ff06cedeb4
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

You've now created a savings variable, so let's start saving!

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The `savings` variable you created in the previous exercise with a value of `100` is available to you.

How much money would you have saved four months from now, if you saved $10 each month?

`@instructions`
- Create a variable `monthly_savings`, equal to `10` and `num_months`, equal to `4`.
- Multiply `monthly_savings` by `num_months` and save it to `new_savings`.
- Add `new_savings` to `savings`, saving the sum as `total_savings`.
- Print the value of `total_savings`.

`@hint`
- You can do calculations with variables the same way as with numbers so instead of `10 * 4`, replace the numbers with the variables!
- Use `print()` to see the amount in `total_savings`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
savings = 100
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months



# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = ____

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = ____

# Print total_savings

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings

# Print total_savings
print(total_savings)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_object("monthly_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you save `10` to `monthly_savings` using `monthly_savings = 10`?")
Ex().check_object("num_months").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you save `4` to `num_months` using `num_months = 4`?")
Ex().check_object("new_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you use the correct variables and symbols to multiply? Expected `monthly_savings * num_months` but got something else.")
Ex().check_object("total_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you use the correct variables and symbols to add? Expected `savings + new_savings` but got something else.")

Ex().has_printout(0, not_printed_msg="Remember to print out `total_savings` at the end of your script.")

success_msg("You now have $140 in savings!")
```

## Other variable types

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 006b48561f
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

In the previous exercise, you worked with the integer Python data type:

- `int`, or integer: a number without a fractional part. `savings`, with the value `100`, is an example of an integer.

Next to numerical data types, there are three other very common data types:

- `float`, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. `1.1`, is an example of a float.
- `str`, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
- `bool`, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. It can only be `True` or `False` (the capitalization is important!).

`@instructions`
- Create a new float, `half`, with the value `0.5`.
- Create a new string, `intro`, with the value `"Hello! How are you?"`.
- Create a new boolean, `is_good`, with the value `True`.

`@hint`
- To create a variable in Python, use `=`. Make sure to wrap your string in single or double quotes.
- Only two boolean values exist in Python: `True` and `False`. `TRUE`, `true`, `FALSE`, `false` and other versions will not be accepted.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a variable half


# Create a variable intro


# Create a variable is_good

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().check_object("half").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you save the float, `0.5` to `half`?")

Ex().check_object("intro").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Hmm, something is incorrect in your `intro` variable. Double check the spelling and make sure you've used quotation marks.")

Ex().check_object("is_good").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg = "Did you capitalize the boolean value? Remember you don't need to use quotation marks here.")

success_msg("Nice!")
```

## Guess the type

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: b35f67514c
lang: python
xp: 50
skills:
  - 2
```

To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) function. Suppose you've defined a variable `a`, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of `a`, simply execute:

```
type(a)
```

We already went ahead and created three variables: `a`, `b` and `c`. You can use the IPython shell to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?

`@possible_answers`
- `a` is of type `int`, `b` is of type `str`, `c` is of type `bool`
- `a` is of type `float`, `b` is of type `bool`, `c` is of type `str`
- `a` is of type `float`, `b` is of type `str`, `c` is of type `bool`
- `a` is of type `int`, `b` is of type `bool`, `c` is of type `str`

`@hint`
Use `type(a)`, `type(b)` and `type(c)` inside the IPython Shell to find out about the variables' types.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
a = 100*0.5
b = "True"
c = False
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = "The type of `a` is not `int`. Try out `type(a)` and see for yourself."
msg2 = "`b` is not a `bool`, it's a `str`! The fact that `True` is wrapped in double quotes makes it a string."
msg3 = "Correcto perfecto!"
msg4 = "None of the variable's types is correct here. Try `type(a)` and see what type this variable is."
Ex().has_chosen(3,[msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4])
```

## Operations with other types

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 4d0d83cc02
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:

```

Hugo mentioned that different types behave differently in Python.

When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.

`@instructions`
- Calculate the product of `monthly_savings` and `num_months`. Store the result in `year_savings`.
- What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of `year_savings`.
- Calculate the sum of `intro` and `intro` and store the result in a new variable `doubleintro`.
- Print out `doubleintro`. Did you expect this?

`@hint`
- Assign `monthly_savings * num_months` to a new variable, `year_savings`.
- To print the type of a variable `x`, use `print(type(x))`.
- Assign `intro + intro` to a new variable, `doubleintro`.
- To print a variable `x`, write `print(x)` in the script.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 12
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate year_savings using monthly_savings and num_months


# Print the type of year_savings


# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro


# Print out doubleintro

```

`@solution`
```{python}
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 12
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate year_savings using monthly_savings and num_months
year_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Print the type of year_savings
print(type(year_savings))

# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro
doubleintro = intro + intro

# Print out doubleintro
print(doubleintro)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
# predefined
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined variables."

Ex().multi(
    check_object('monthly_savings', missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg),
    check_object('num_months', missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg),
    check_object('intro', missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)
)

Ex().multi(
    check_object("year_savings").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Multiply `monthly_savings` and `num_months` to create the `year_savings` variable."),
    has_printout(0, not_printed_msg = "__JINJA__:Use `{{sol_call}}` to print out the type of `year_savings`.")
)

Ex().multi(
    check_object("doubleintro").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg  = "Have you stored the result of `intro + intro` in `doubleintro`?"),
    has_printout(1, not_printed_msg = "Don't forget to print out `doubleintrp`.")
)

success_msg("Nice. Notice how `intro + intro` causes `\"Hello! How are you?\"` and `\"Hello! How are you?\"` to be pasted together.")
```

## Type conversion

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 085bb602b9
lang: python
xp: 100
skills:
  - 2
```

Using the `+` operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages.

Suppose, for example, that you've calculated your savings want to summarize the results in a string.

To do this, you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), to convert a value into a string. `str(savings)`, for example, will convert the integer `savings` to a string.

Similar functions such as [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) and [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) will help you convert Python values into any type.

`@instructions`
- Hit _Run Code_ to run the code. Try to understand the error message.
- Fix the code such that the printout runs without errors; use the function [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) to convert the variables `savings` and `total_savings` to strings.
- Convert the variable `pi_string` to a float and store this float as a new variable, `pi_float`.

`@hint`
- The error message when you _Run Code_ for the first time is telling you that you have an error in line 6 where at least one of your variables is not a string.
- You should use [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) twice!
- Use [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) on `pi_string` and store the result in `pi_float`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Definition of savings and total_savings
savings = 100
total_savings = 150

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + savings + " and now have $" + total_savings + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Definition of savings and total_savings
savings = 100
total_savings = 150

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(total_savings) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
```

`@sct`
```{python}

# ensure predefined values are unmodified
msg = "You don't have to change or remove the predefined variables."
Ex().multi(
    check_object("savings", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg),
    check_object("total_savings", missing_msg=msg).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg=msg)
)

Ex().check_correct(
    has_printout(0),
    multi(
        check_function("str", 0).check_args(0).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Inside the `print()` command, make sure to convert `savings` into a string with `str(savings)`."),
        check_function("str", 1).check_args(0).has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Inside the `print()` command, make sure to convert `total_savings` into a string `str(total_savings)`.")
    )
)

# check pi_float
Ex().check_correct(
    check_object("pi_float").has_equal_value(),
    multi(
        check_object("pi_string").has_equal_value(),
        check_function("float", missing_msg = "In order to convert `pi_string` to a float, be sure to use the `float()` function.").has_equal_value(incorrect_msg="Use `float(pi_string) to create the variable `pi_float`.")
    )
)

success_msg("Great! You have saved $150; that's pretty awesome indeed!")
```

## Can Python handle everything?

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: 3e5f0bdf3a
lang: python
xp: 50

```

Now that you know something more about combining different sources of information, have a look at the four Python expressions below.
Which one of these will throw an error? You can always copy and paste this code in the IPython Shell to find out!

`@possible_answers`
- `"I can add integers, like "  + str(5) + " to strings."`
- `"I said " + ("Hey " * 2) + "Hey!"`
- `"The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number " + 2`
- `True + False`

`@hint`
Copy and paste the different expressions into the IPython Shell and try to figure out which one throws an error.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = "Incorrect, this command runs perfectly fine."
msg2 = "It's perfectly possible to 'multiply strings' in Python..."
msg3 = "Correct! Because you're not converting `2` to a string with [str()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), this will give an error."
msg4 = "`True + False` doesn't error out. Feel free to try it in the console to confirm!"
Ex().has_chosen(3, [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4])
```
